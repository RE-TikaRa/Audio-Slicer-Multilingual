## Features

- Automatic slicing based on silence detection
- Preview of slice ranges and length distribution
- Output formats: wav / flac / mp3
- Multilingual UI
- Drag & drop audio import

## Quick Start

### Windows

- Release: download from GitHub Releases and run `slicer-gui.exe`.
- Source: double-click `main.bat` in the project root.

### macOS & Linux

```shell
uv sync
uv run python scripts/slicer-gui.py
```
### CLI

```shell
uv run python scripts/slicer.py path/to/audio.wav
```

## Usage

- Add audio files by clicking “Add Audio Files...” or drag & drop them into the window.
- Parameters are on the Settings panel at the right.
- Language switch: use the Language dropdown in the Settings panel.
- Enable “Open output directory when finished” to open the output folder automatically.

## Parameters

- Threshold: areas below this RMS value are treated as silence, default -40 dB.
- Minimum Length: minimum slice length (ms), default 5000.
- Minimum Interval: minimum silence length for slicing (ms), default 300.
- Hop Size: RMS frame size (ms), default 10.
- Maximum Silence Length: max kept silence around slices (ms), default 1000.

## Project Structure

- `src/audio_slicer/`: core code
  - `gui/`: main window and UI
  - `utils/`: slicing and preview utilities
  - `modules/`: i18n strings
- `scripts/`: entry scripts
- `tools/`: packaging and version info
- `assets/`: screenshots and UI files
## Packaging (Windows)

```pwsh
pwsh tools/pack-gui.ps1
```

Output: `dist/slicer-gui`, ZIP: `dist/slicer-gui-windows.zip`.

## Troubleshooting

- `Illegal Audio-MPEG-Header` or mpg123 resync errors:
  - Often caused by corrupted/non-standard audio or mismatched extension/codec.
  - Convert to WAV/FLAC with ffmpeg and try again.

- Preview or slicing fails:
  - Ensure the file can be decoded (playable in other players).
